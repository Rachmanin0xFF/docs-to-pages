# docs-to-pages

## What is this?

GitHub (this website) lets users host [static web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) for free with a service called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). However, using this service requires a little technical know-how that can seem daunting for non-programmer folk. 

**docs-to-pages** is a project that *automatically creates a static website* from a **Google Drive folder**. It takes all the Google Docs in the folder and splats them onto a web page. You don't have to download anything, compile anything, or run anything. Everything runs right on GitHub's servers. Also, it's free.
