# docs-to-pages

## Edit:

This is embarrasing, but I made this without realizing that [Google Sites](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310491?hl=en&ref_topic=9296431&sjid=7374933347667609170-NA) was a thing. Just use that, please.

This was a good learning experience (I feel comfortable with GitHub Actions now), but I think the real lesson is 'do your research!'.

## What is this?

GitHub (this website) lets users host [static web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) for free with a service called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Meanwhile, [Google Docs](https://www.docs.google.com/) is a free, online collaborative word processor that can edit files in [Google Drive](https://www.drive.google.com/).

**docs-to-pages** is a project that *automatically creates a static website* from a **Google Drive folder**. It takes all the Google Docs in the folder and splats them onto a web page. You don't have to download anything, compile anything, or do anything complicated. Everything runs right on GitHub's servers (for free).

## Instructions

Here's an [instruction set for technically-competent users](instructions/v2.md). If you're not comfortable with this sort of thing and you *still* want to use this over [Google Sites](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310491?hl=en&ref_topic=9296431&sjid=7374933347667609170-NA) (for some reason), then, uh... what???
